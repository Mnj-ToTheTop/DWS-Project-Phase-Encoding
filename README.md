# Project Overview

- This project demonstrates Audio Steganography using the Phase Encoding technique.
- In phase encoding, secret information is hidden in the phase component of an audio signal — a subtle modification that is nearly imperceptible to the human ear.

1. ***The notebook allows you to:***
    - Encode a secret text message inside a .wav audio file.
    - Decode and retrieve the hidden message from the stego audio file.

2. ***Features***
    - Implements phase encoding-based steganography.
    - Works with .wav audio files.
    - Supports message encoding and decoding.
    - Pads messages (if needed) for consistency.
    - Demonstrates a full encode → decode cycle.
